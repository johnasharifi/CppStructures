# CppStructures

The purpose of this repository is to force me to train myself in writing C++ from scratch without Intellisense, compiled run-throughs, or syntax highlighting.

 Some quick implementations of procedural content in C++.

# Setting up work environment

    docker pull gcc
    docker run -it gcc
    
    apt-get update
    apt-install vim -y
    
    g++ --version > g++ (GCC) 10.2.0
