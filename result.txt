initialized. value is now 2
doubled. value is now 4
before re-pointing, const ptrToClass address is 0x1f80eb0
after re-pointing const ptrToClass to new ptrToClass(3), address is 0x1f81ee0
ptr value was initialized to 3. value is still 3
ptr2 address is 4
ptrToConstInt originally pointed at value 4
ptrToConstInt now points at value 5
